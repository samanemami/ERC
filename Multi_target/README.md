# SST
Stacked single-target

This project is a reproduction of the introduced SST model by[1]. To reference the main paper, please refer [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-016-5546-z). The main work is presented in Java [here](https://github.com/lefman/mulan-extended).

# ERC
Ensemble of Regressor Chains

I wrote an algorithm to reproduce an ERC algorithm of the Multi-target regression via input space expansion: treating targets as inputs paper[1]. To reference the main paper, please refer [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-016-5546-z). The main work is presented in Java [here](https://github.com/lefman/mulan-extended).
